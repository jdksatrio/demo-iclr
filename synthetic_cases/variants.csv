Adjuvant Therapy in Vulvar Cancer|59-year-old woman presented with a 1.5-cm left mid–labia majora lesion not approaching midline. Clinically, she had no palpable groin nodes. She underwent left modified radical vulvectomy and left sentinel node dissection. Pathology revealed a 2.1-cm squamous cell carcinoma on left labia majora with negative margins >1 cm, no LVSI, and 3-mm stromal invasion. 2 sentinel nodes were removed from left inguinofemoral region; both were negative.
Adjuvant Therapy in Vulvar Cancer|71-year-old woman with a painful 4-cm mass arising in the right midlabia. Clinically, she has a palpable right groin mass, left groin has no clinically palpable adenopathy. CT pelvis shows multiple enlarged lymph nodes in bilateral groins. The right mass appears to be 3 cm in size radiographically. No enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvis. She underwent right modified radical vulvectomy and bilateral lymph node dissection. Pathology revealed a 3.8-cm squamous cell carcinoma on the right labia majora with 1.2-cm stromal invasion, negative margins. The right inguinofemoral dissection revealed a conglomerate of lymph nodes measuring 3.2 cm with extracapsular lymph node extension and LVSI. The left groin dissection revealed 1 positive lymph node with an 8-mm tumor deposit. 6 additional lymph nodes were negative. The patient has 2+ right lower extremity lymphedema.
